## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and logout functionality.
- **Form Management**: View, create, edit, and delete forms.
- **Multi-step Form Creation**: Guided step-by-step form creation with client-side validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern UI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js 12.x or higher
- Yarn or npm installed (Yarn preferred for performance reasons)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://yourrepository.com/next-admin-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd next-admin-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
